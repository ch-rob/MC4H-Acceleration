## Reference Architectures

Below is a high level reference architecture that shows one potential way these pieces can work together for a full stack Microsoft Cloud for Heatlhcare solution to Patient Outreach. This is a good reference but should be tailored to each customerâ€™s specific use case. For instance, data ingestion from Azure FHIR Services to D365 Customer Insights may use $export to ADLS instead depending on data volume and complexity.
